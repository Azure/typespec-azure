## Breaking Changes

### `Azure.Core` operation customization has changed

Prior to the January 2023 release, `Azure.Core` lifecycle operations were customized using a `TCustom` template parameter which expected a `parameters` and/or `response` property which indicates the customizations to be applied for that operation.

In this release, we have changed to a new Service Traits design which is more flexible and enables customizations for individual operations as well as all operations across an entire service specification.

Documentation and additional details can be found in this page of the `Azure.Core` documentation:

https://azure.github.io/typespec-azure/docs/getstarted/azure-core/step09

#### Migrating to the new model

If you have previously been customizing operation parameters using the `parameters` field of `TCustom`, you should now use either `QueryParametersTrait` or `RequestHeadersTrait`. If you were customizing response headers with the `response` field of `TCustom`, you should now use `ResponseHeadersTrait` for customization.

The documentation link above explains how to use these trait types.

## Deprecations

:::caution
Deprecated items will be removed in 2 release cycles.
:::

### `@collectionFormat` decorator is deprecated

The `@collectionFormat` decorator in `@azure-tools/typespec-autorest` is deprecated in favor of a new 'format' option in the `@query` and `@header` decorators. Note that "csv" is the new default format for representing array types in headers, while "multi" is the default format for representing array types in query parameters.

For example

```typespec
model Widget {
  @collectionFormat("multi")
  @query
  colors: string[];

  @collectionFormat("csv")
  @header("x-ms-flanges")
  flanges: string[];
}
```

should be changed to

```typespec
model Widget {
  @query({
    format: "multi",
  })
  colors: string[];

  @header({
    name: "x-ms-flanges",
    format: "csv",
  })
  flanges: string[];
}
```

or, taking advantage of the default format for headers and query parameters

```typespec
model Widget {
  @query colors: string[];
  @header("x-ms-flanges") flanges: string[];
}
```
