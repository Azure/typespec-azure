This page outlines the steps to build a client library based on your TypeSpec specification. It provides a guide for the whole process from initial API design to the release of SDKs. please visit https://aka.ms/azsdk/dpcodegen.

The best documentation on how to generate can be found using those links:

At a glance, add your emitter name to your `package.json`, along with the right options in the `tspconfig.yaml`.

> **NOTE:** Generating all languages from the same folder may be complicated due to the preview status of the emitters and TypeSpec libraries, such as `typespec-azure-core` and `typespec-azure-resource-manager`.
> It is recommended to have a unique language emitter in each `package.json` to avoid conflicts until all emitters and the TypeSpec libraries reach their first stable release.

Modify your `package.json` to include the necessary dependencies for the language emitter(s). Remember to run `npm install` after making changes to the file:

```json
{
  "name": "clients",
  "dependencies": {
    "@typespec/compiler": "latest",
    "@typespec/rest": "latest",
    "@typespec/http": "latest",
    "@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core": "latest",
    "@azure-tools/typespec-python": "latest"
  },
  "private": true
}
```

Always update your `tspconfig.yaml` file rather than passing options through the command line.

```yaml
emit:
  # Emitter for Swagger files with Autorest Extensions
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-autorest"
  # add "@azure-tools/typespec-python" to your package.json to generate Python code
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-python"
  # add "@azure-tools/typespec-java" to your package.json to generate Java code
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-java"
  # add "@azure-tools/typespec-csharp" to your package.json to generate C# code
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-csharp"
  # add "@azure-tools/typespec-ts" to your package.json to generate Typescript code
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-ts"
options:
  "@azure-tools/typespec-python":
    package-name: azure-service-template
```

Several language repositories utilize the `tsp-client` tool to simplify generating client libraries. For more information on the tool, see [Getting started with `tsp-client`](<./../Generating with tsp-client/tsp_client.md>).
