This page provides instructions on setting up customization for TypeSpec to include client-specific customizations in the generated code.

Ensure that your `package.json` includes a link to the customization library, `typespec-client-generator-core`:

```json
{
  "name": "clients",
  "dependencies": {
    "@typespec/compiler": "latest",
    "@typespec/http": "latest",
    "@typespec/rest": "latest",
    "@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core": "latest",
    "@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core": "latest"
  },
  "private": true
}
```

Customization should be implemented in a file named `client.tsp`, which should be used alongside with the `main.tsp`.

```typespec
// client.tsp
import "./main.tsp";
import "@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core";

using Azure.ClientGenerator.Core;

// Add your customizations here
```

After you've created your customization file, use the command `tsp compile client.tsp` to generate output that includes your customizations:

```shell
tsp compile client.tsp
```
