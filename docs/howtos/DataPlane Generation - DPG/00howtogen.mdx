# How to generate DPG

This page documents how to build a Data-Plane SDK from your TYPESPEC specification. For an overview of the whole process from initial API design to shipping SDKs, please visit https://aka.ms/azsdk/dpcodegen.

The best documentation on how to generate can found using those links:

At a glance, add your emitter name to your `package.json`, along with the right options in the `tspconfig.yaml`.

> **NOTE:** It may be complicated to generate all languages from the same folder at the moment as DPG and `typespec-azure-core` are still in preview.
> It's recommended that you keep each `package.json` with a unique language emitter, as they are likely to conflict, until all emitters and `typespec-azure-core`
> reach their first stable release.

Update your `package.json` to contain dependencies on DPG language emitter(s). Don't forget to do `npm install` after an update of the file:

```json
{
  "name": "clients",
  "dependencies": {
    "@typespec/compiler": "latest",
    "@typespec/rest": "latest",
    "@typespec/http": "latest",
    "@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core": "latest",
    "@azure-tools/typespec-python": "latest"
  },
  "private": true
}
```

To get your code emitting without having to pass several options on the command line, the easiest way is to update your `tspconfig.yaml` file:

```yaml
emit:
  # Emitter for Swagger files with Autorest Extensions
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-autorest"
  # add "@azure-tools/typespec-python" to your package.json to generate Python code
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-python"
  # add "@azure-tools/typespec-java" to your package.json to generate Java code
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-java"
  # add "@azure-tools/typespec-csharp" to your package.json to generate C# code
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-csharp"
  # add "@azure-tools/typespec-ts" to your package.json to generate Typescript code
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-ts"
options:
  "@azure-tools/typespec-python":
    package-name: azure-service-template
```

Several language repositories support the `tsp-client` tool to facilitate generating client libraries. For more information on the tool, see [Getting started with `tsp-client`](<./../Generating with tsp-client/tsp_client.md>).
