ARM list responses must use a predictable envelope containing exactly an array-valued `value` and
`nextLink`. Additional top-level properties or a missing envelope property make generated clients
and pagination tooling handle list operations inconsistently.

## Impact

- **Area:** API

Collection response envelopes with other shapes violate the ARM RPC contract and can produce
inconsistent generated client pagination behavior.

The rule combines collection-path and paging-metadata checks under the existing
`list-response-envelope` rule name. ARM-provider collection GET paths retain their
envelope validation. Authored `@list` operations with a paging `@nextLink` are also
checked, including POST list actions and operations without provider metadata.
Inherited envelope properties are included. The `value` property must be an array,
and the next-link property must be named `nextLink`, not a custom envelope name.
Prefer standard ARM list operation templates, which provide this envelope.

## ❌ Incorrect

```tsp
model WidgetListResult {
  value: Widget[];
  nextLink?: string;
  totalCount?: int32;
}

@route("/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Contoso.Widgets/widgets")
@get
op listWidgets(@path subscriptionId: string): WidgetListResult;
```

## ✅ Correct

```tsp
model WidgetListResult {
  value: Widget[];
  nextLink?: string;
}

@route("/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Contoso.Widgets/widgets")
@get
op listWidgets(@path subscriptionId: string): WidgetListResult;
```

## LintDiff Equivalent

This rule corresponds to the Swagger validator rule
[GetCollectionOnlyHasValueAndNextLink](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/blob/main/packages/rulesets/src/spectral/functions/get-collection-only-has-value-and-next-link.ts).
It also incorporates the value-array requirement from
[CollectionObjectPropertiesNaming](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openapi-validator/blob/main/docs/collection-object-properties-naming.md).

## Suppression

Suppress this rule only when compatibility requirements prevent the response envelope from
containing exactly `value` and `nextLink`.
