## Breaking Changes

- There are breaking changes in the TypeSpec core libraries, see [the release notes](https://microsoft.github.io/typespec/release-notes/release-2023-11-07) for details.

### Typescript types breaking change

The `package.json` files for all packages have been changed to use the standard `types` field instead of the legacy `typesVersions` field to specify types for subpath exports. This means that packages consuming TypeSpec must use the `moduleResolution` setting with `node16` or `nodenext` in their `tsconfig.json`.
You might see the following error:

```bash
Cannot find module '@typespec/compiler/testing'. Did you mean to set the 'moduleResolution' option to 'nodenext'
```

This can be resolved by changing the following in `tsconfig.json`:

```diff
-"moduleResolution": "ESNext",
+"moduleResolution": "node16",
```

### Dropped Support for Node version 16

- All typespec packages now specify node 18 as the minimum version. Consuming packages should no longer use node 16 and update the node specification in the `engines` section of their package.json file appropriately.

### `@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core` Breaking Changes

- Removed `Inprogress` from `OperationState` enum. Added `Running`, `NotStarted` states. All APIs that use this enumeration for operation status values will now include these states.
