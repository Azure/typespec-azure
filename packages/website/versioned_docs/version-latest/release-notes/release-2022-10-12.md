# Release Notes October 2022 (2022-10-12)

This release contains **breaking changes**

Change to compiler, rest libraries [See TypeSpec Core release notes](https://microsoft.github.io/typespec/docs/release-notes/release-2022-10-12/)

- **`TypeSpec`**: Cannot `extends` or `is` a model expression via alias
- **`Api`**: Removed `createProgram` and changed `compile` parameter order
- **`TypeSpec`** **Deprecation** `@service` decorator replacing `@serviceTitle` and `@serviceVersion`
- **`TypeSpec`** **`Api`**: Move `@discriminator` to compiler

Change to Azure libraries:

- **`TypeSpec`** `Azure.ResourceManager` Operations Interface explicitly required
- **`Emitter`** `typespec-provider-hub-controller` Deprecate `service-code-path`

## **`TypeSpec`** `Azure.ResourceManager` Operations Interface explicitly required

Previous version of the Azure.ResourceManager depended on a weird behavior of the operation resolution which automatically included the `Operations` interface.
You now have to explicitly include this interface in your Arm spec.

```typespec
// Add this to your spec.
interface Operations extends Azure.ResourceManager.Operations {}
```
