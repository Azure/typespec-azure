This release contains **breaking changes**

See TypeSpec Core [release notes](https://microsoft.github.io/typespec/release-notes/release-2023-07-11)

## New Features

### `@azure-tools/typespec-autorest` emitter

- Deterministically order properties in generated OpenAPI documents. This will cause some ordering changes in this release, but should prevent ordering changes in the future.
- Allow use of an `enum` type as a discriminator
- Add warning for unsupported empty `enum` types
- Show error details when failing to load an example file
- Add support for nullable `enum` properties
- Omit `x-typespec-name` extension by default from autorest output. A new configuration and command line option `include-x-typespec-name: \"inline-only\" | \"never\"` has been added to get previous behavior
- Allow `readonly` schema for long-running operation status values, like `provisioningState`. Enable the new configuration option `use-read-only-status-schema: true` to get the new behavior.
- Support non-specific scalar types like `numeric`, `integer` and `float`. Emit a warning when these types are used and emit the best approximation for the type.

### `@azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager` library

- Add operation templates to support new Asynchronous delete API guidelines `ArmResourceDeleteWithoutOkAsync`
- Add operation templates to support new Asynchronous action operations with no return value `ArmResourceActionNoResponseContentAsync`

### `@azure-tools/typespec-providerhub-controller` emitter

- Support non-specific scalar types like `numeric`, `integer` and `float`. Emit a warning when these types are used and emit the best c-sharp approximation for the type.

### `Microsoft.Providerhub.Controller.Common` library

- Add types to model valid and invalid `ValidationResponse` types used in `Validate<Operation>` extension methods

## Bug Fixes

### `@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core` bug fixes

- Correct `GetLroMetadata` response for operations not tied to a resource (e.g. RPC operations)

### `@azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager` bug fixes

- Fix generated route for `CheckLocalNameAvailability` operation template
- Update `LocationParameter` to reference ARM common types

### `@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core` bug fixes

- fix for decorator about `scalar extends string/numeric`

### `@azure-tools/typespec-providerhub-controller` emitter bug fixes

- Emit generated versioning classes with models rather than with controllers, fixing issues with solutions with separate controller and model projects
- Fix serialization issue with core `ResourceBase` type
- Fix issues with getting started documentation in dotnet 7.0

### `Microsoft.Providerhub.Controller.Common` library bug fixes

- Fix serialization of SerializationInfo property for resource models

## New Linting Rules (`@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core`)

- Use standard names for operations
- Ensure `NoContent` (204) responses do not have a response body and `OK` (200) and `Created` (201) responses have a response body
- Ensure RPC operations marked with `@get` or `@delete` don't have request bodies
- Require `@useAuth` decorator on Azure services
- Discourage overriding the HTTP verb on standard operations
- Discourage custom 4xx and 5xx responses

## Deprecations

### `@azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager` deprecations

- `ArmResourceDeleteAsync` is deprecated due to new ARM RPC guidelines. Asynchronous delete operations should use `ArmResourceDeleteWithoutOkAsync`
- `ArmResourceActionNoContentAsync` is deprecated due to new ARM RPC guidelines. Asynchronous actions with no response value should use `ArmResourceActionNoResponseContentAsync`

## Breaking Changes

There are breaking changes in typespec core libraries, see [release notes](https://microsoft.github.io/typespec/release-notes/release-2023-07-11) for details.
