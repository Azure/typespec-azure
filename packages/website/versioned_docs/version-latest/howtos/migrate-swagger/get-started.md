# Migrate Azure API spec from swagger to TypeSpec

We have created a swagger to TypeSpec conversion tool to help take on the bulk of the manual conversion labor. It can handle both data-plane and management-plane swaggers. The produced TypeSpec relies on the Azure.Core and Azure.Resource.Manager libraries.

**_Important!_** Because TypeSpec is more expressive than Swagger and with the help of evolving Azure libraries, this tool should only be used as an aid in the conversion/migration process, not as the sole tool to produce final version of TypeSpec specs without human inspection, correction and optimization.

## Steps of running the tool

- Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 18.3 LTS or later is installed.
- Install [`@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-cli):

```shell
npm install -g @azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-cli
```

- Run the tool from the directory you would like to output your files.

  - Convert a **data-plane** specification:

    ```shell
    tsp-client convert --swagger-readme [path to readme.md]
    ```

  - Convert a **control-plane** specification:

    ```shell
    tsp-client convert --swagger-readme [path to readme.md] --arm
    ```

- Review generated TypeSpec
- Layout [the TypeSpec project folders appropriately](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/documentation/typespec-structure-guidelines.md).
- Leverage standard `tspconfig.yaml` ([Template projects](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/tree/main/eng/feeds)) and make appropriate output file name changes.
- Ensure it compiles successfully locally and then submit a PR
- Review CI checks such as breaking changes and other failures.
