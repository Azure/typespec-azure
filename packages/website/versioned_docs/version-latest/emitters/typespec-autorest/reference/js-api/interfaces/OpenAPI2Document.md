## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `consumes?` | `string`[] | A list of MIME types the APIs can consume. This is global to all APIs but can be overridden on specific API calls |
| `definitions?` | `Record`<`string`, [`OpenAPI2Schema`](../type-aliases/OpenAPI2Schema.md)\> | Data types that can be consumed and produced by operations |
| `externalDocs?` | [`OpenAPI2ExternalDocs`](OpenAPI2ExternalDocs.md) | Additional external documentation. |
| `host?` | `string` | The host (name or ip) serving the API. This MUST be the host only and does not include the scheme nor sub-paths. It MAY include a port.<br />If the host is not included, the host serving the documentation is to be used (including the port). The host does not support path templating. |
| `info` | [`OpenAPI2Info`](OpenAPI2Info.md) | Provides metadata about the API. The metadata can be used by the clients if needed. |
| `parameters?` | `Record`<`string`, [`OpenAPI2Parameter`](../type-aliases/OpenAPI2Parameter.md)\> | parameters that can be used across operations |
| `paths` | `Record`<`string`, [`OpenAPI2PathItem`](../type-aliases/OpenAPI2PathItem.md)\> | The available paths and operations for the API |
| `produces?` | `string`[] | A list of MIME types the APIs can produce. This is global to all APIs but can be overridden on specific API calls |
| `schemes?` | `string`[] | The transfer protocol of the API. Values MUST be from the list: "http", "https", "ws", "wss". |
| `security?` | [`OpenAPI2SecurityRequirement`](../type-aliases/OpenAPI2SecurityRequirement.md)[] | A declaration of which security schemes are applied for the API as a whole. The list of values describes alternative security schemes that can be used (that is, there is a logical OR between the security requirements). Individual operations can override this definition |
| `securityDefinitions?` | `Record`<`string`, [`OpenAPI2SecurityScheme`](../type-aliases/OpenAPI2SecurityScheme.md)\> | Security scheme definitions that can be used across the specification |
| `swagger` | `"2.0"` | - |
| `tags?` | [`OpenAPI2Tag`](OpenAPI2Tag.md)[] | A list of tags used by the specification with additional metadata.<br />The order of the tags can be used to reflect on their order by the parsing tools.<br />Not all tags that are used by the Operation Object must be declared.<br />The tags that are not declared may be organized randomly or based on the tools' logic. Each tag name in the list MUST be unique. |
| `x-ms-parameterized-host?` | [`XMSParameterizedHost`](XMSParameterizedHost.md) | When used, replaces the standard OpenAPI "host" attribute with a host that contains variables to be replaced as part of method execution or client construction, very similar to how path parameters work. |
| `x-ms-paths?` | `Record`<`string`, [`OpenAPI2PathItem`](../type-aliases/OpenAPI2PathItem.md)\> | Additional paths and operations that cannot be used in `paths` as the url is not unique.<br />This can be used to provide operation overload using a query param.<br /><br />**Example**<br />` "/foo?type=abc" returning FooA and "/foo?type=xyz" returning FooB are not allowed in `paths` as there is query params. ` |
