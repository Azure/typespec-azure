## Type declaration

| Member | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `additionalProperties` | `boolean` \| [`Refable`](Refable.md)<[`OpenAPI2Schema`](OpenAPI2Schema.md)\> | indicates that additional unlisted properties can exist in this schema |
| `allOf` | [`Refable`](Refable.md)<[`OpenAPI2Schema`](OpenAPI2Schema.md)\>[] | Swagger allows combining and extending model definitions using the allOf property of JSON Schema, in effect offering model composition.<br />allOf takes in an array of object definitions that are validated independently but together compose a single object.<br />While composition offers model extensibility, it does not imply a hierarchy between the models.<br />To support polymorphism, Swagger adds the support of the discriminator field.<br />When used, the discriminator will be the name of the property used to decide which schema definition is used to validate the structure of the model.<br />As such, the discriminator field MUST be a required field. The value of the chosen property has to be the friendly name given to the model under the<br />definitions property. As such, inline schema definitions, which do not have a given id, cannot be used in polymorphism. |
| `default` | `string` \| `boolean` \| `number` \| `Record`<`string`, `unknown`\> | Declares the value of the property that the server will use if none is provided,<br />for example a "count" to control the number of results per page might default to 100 if not supplied by the client in the request.<br /><br />**Note**<br />"default" has no meaning for required parameters.) See https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fge-json-schema-validation-00#section-6.2. Unlike JSON Schema this value MUST conform to the defined type for this parameter. |
| `description` | `string` | This attribute is a string that provides a full description of the schema |
| `discriminator` | `string` | Adds support for polymorphism. The discriminator is the schema property name that is used to differentiate between other schema that inherit this schema.<br />The property name used MUST be defined at this schema and it MUST be in the required property list. When used, the value MUST be the name of this schema<br />or any schema that inherits it. |
| `enum` | (`string` \| `number` \| `boolean`)[] | Restrict a value to a fixed set of values. It must be an array with at least one element, where each element is unique. |
| `exclusiveMaximum` | `boolean` | indicates that the maximum is exclusive of the number given |
| `exclusiveMinimum` | `boolean` | indicates that the minimum is exclusive of the number given |
| `format` | `string` | The extending format for the previously mentioned type. |
| `items` | [`Refable`](Refable.md)<[`OpenAPI2Schema`](OpenAPI2Schema.md)\> | Describes the type of items in the array. |
| `maxItems` | `number` | An array instance is valid against "maxItems" if its size is less than, or equal to, the value of this keyword. |
| `maxLength` | `number` | A string instance is valid against this keyword if its length is less than, or equal to, the value of this keyword. |
| `maxProperties` | `number` | An object instance is valid against "maxProperties" if its number of properties is less than, or equal to, the value of this keyword. |
| `maximum` | `number` | the maximum value for the property<br /><br />if "exclusiveMaximum" is not present, or has boolean value false, then the instance is valid if it is lower than, or equal to, the value of "maximum";<br /><br />if "exclusiveMaximum" has boolean value true, the instance is valid if it is strictly lower than the value of "maximum". |
| `minItems` | `number` | An array instance is valid against "minItems" if its size is greater than, or equal to, the value of this keyword. |
| `minLength` | `number` | A string instance is valid against this keyword if its length is greater than, or equal to, the value of this keyword. |
| `minProperties` | `number` | An object instance is valid against "minProperties" if its number of properties is greater than, or equal to, the value of this keyword. |
| `minimum` | `number` | the minimum value for the property<br /><br />if "exclusiveMinimum" is not present, or has boolean value false, then the instance is valid if it is greater than, or equal to, the value of "minimum";<br /><br />if "exclusiveMinimum" has boolean value true, the instance is valid if it is strictly greater than the value of "minimum". |
| `pattern` | `string` | A string instance is considered valid if the regular expression matches the instance successfully. |
| `properties` | `Record`<`string`, [`OpenAPI2SchemaProperty`](OpenAPI2SchemaProperty.md)\> | This attribute is an object with property definitions that define the<br />valid values of instance object property values. When the instance<br />value is an object, the property values of the instance object MUST<br />conform to the property definitions in this object. In this object,<br />each property definition's value MUST be a schema, and the property's<br />name MUST be the name of the instance property that it defines.  The<br />instance property value MUST be valid according to the schema from<br />the property definition. Properties are considered unordered, the<br />order of the instance properties MAY be in any order. |
| `readOnly` | `boolean` | Relevant only for Schema "properties" definitions. Declares the property as "read only". This means that it MAY be sent as part of a response but MUST NOT<br />be sent as part of the request. Properties marked as readOnly being true SHOULD NOT be in the required list of the defined schema. Default value is false. |
| `required` | `string`[] | A list of property names that are required to be sent from the client to the server. |
| `title` | `string` | This attribute is a string that provides a short description of the schema. |
| `type` | [`JsonType`](JsonType.md) | The JSON type for the schema |
| `uniqueItems` | `boolean` | if this keyword has boolean value false, the instance validates successfully.  If it has boolean value true, the instance validates successfully if all of its elements are unique. |
| `x-ms-enum` | `Object` | - |
| `x-ms-enum.modelAsString` | `boolean` | If the enum should be extensible. |
| `x-ms-enum.name` | `string` | Name of the enum. |
| `x-ms-enum.values` | `Object`[] | Provide alternative name and description for enum values. |
| `x-ms-mutability` | `string`[] | - |
