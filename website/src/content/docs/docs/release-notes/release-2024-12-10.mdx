## Notable changes

### Azure Resource Manager: Added Common Types Version 6

Added support for version 6 of Azure common types, including changes to private links and managed identity

## Breaking changes

### Removed `@nextLink` decorator from Azure.core

Specs should use the core decorator for `@nextLink`

#### Before

```TypeSpec
model WidgetPage {
  items: Widget[];

  @Azure.Core.nextLink
  nextLink: string;
}
```

#### After

```TypeSpec
model WidgetPage {
  items: Widget[];
  //In the TypeSpec namespace
  @nextLink
  nextLink: string;
}
```
