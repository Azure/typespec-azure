## Breaking Changes

### @azure-tools/typespec-autorest

- [#2576](https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/pull/2576) Modify how `x-nullable` is resolved when a `$ref` is present.

  Previously, the `$ref` was placed inside an `allOf`. With this change, the `$ref` is now moved directly next to `x-nullable`.

  ```diff lang=json
  "Dog": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
    "type": {
      - "type": "object",
        "x-nullable": true,
      + "$ref": "#/definitions/Pet"
      - "allOf": [
      -   {
      -     "$ref": "#/definitions/Pet"
      -   }
      - ]
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "type"
    ]
  }
  ```

## Features

### @azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core

## Bug Fixes

### @azure-tools/typespec-autorest

- [#2538](https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/pull/2538) Fixing gaps in the `@identifiers` decorator functionality:

  - The value of the `@identifier` decorator is determined by the `ModelProperty`, not the array type.
  - The `@armProviderNamespace` is correctly identified in both scenarios: when applied to the array type or the model property.
- [#2606](https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/pull/2606) Fix unsupported param type diagnostic to target the model property with the issue

### @azure-tools/typespec-azure-resource-manager

- [#2250](https://github.com/Azure/typespec-azure/pull/2250) Addressing common type differences with common types in azure-rest-api-specs, such as ordering of elements, lower/upper case in definition names, typos, and incorrect format on the next link.
