import { ClientTabs, ClientTabItem } from "@components/client-tabs";

This page explains how the license info is generated in the client code.

## Azure license

For Azure scenarios, client code will always use the MIT license and include the license info in the header of the generated code or in a separate file depending on the language.

For example, this is the license comment in the generated code of a Java client:

```java
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
// Licensed under the MIT License.
```

This is the `LICENSE` file of a Python client library:

```text

LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,

THE SOFTWARE.
```

## Unbranded license

For unbranded scenarios, client code will have no license info if there is no license configuration in `tspconfig.yaml`.
Spec authors can set the license info with the `license` configuration in the `tspconfig.yaml`:

```yaml
license:
  name: <License name. We have built-in "MIT License", "Apache License 2.0", "BSD 3-Clause License", "MPL 2.0", "GPL-3.0", and "LGPL-3.0". For other licenses, you need to set the link, header, and description manually.>
  company: <Company name used in copyright>
  link: <License link>
  header: <License header in the generated code>
  description: <License description in the separate license file>
```

For example, if you configure the license like the following, you will get the same license info as Azure scenarios:

```yaml
emit:
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-python"
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-java"
options:
  "@azure-tools/typespec-python":
    license:
      name: "MIT License"
      company: "Microsoft Corporation"
  "@azure-tools/typespec-java":
    license:
      name: "MIT License"
      company: "Microsoft Corporation"
```
