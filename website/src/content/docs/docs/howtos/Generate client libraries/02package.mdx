title: Common behavior for client package
---

import { ClientTabs, ClientTabItem } from "@components/client-tabs";

This page documents the common bahavior for a client package, including the service, namespace, license, etc.

## Service

The service is the entry point for a client library. Currently, we only support one service per package.The service is defined by the `@service` decorator. If multiple services are defined, the first one will be used as the entry point.

## Namespace

Clients, models, enums, and unions in TypeSpec have namespace information. Language's code generator use it in different ways to organize the generated code.

### Basic cases

<ClientTabs>

```typespec title="main.tsp"
@service(#{ title: "Pet Store" })
namespace PetStore;

@route("/feed")
op feed(food: Food): void;

model Food {
  name: string;
  quantity: int32;
}
```

```python
# TODO
```

```csharp
// TODO
```

```typescript
// TODO
```

```java
// TODO
```

</ClientTabs>

### Customization

You could use `@clientNamespace` to change the namespace for specific client, enum, model or union.

<ClientTabs>

```typespec title="main.tsp"
@service(#{ title: "Pet Store" })
namespace PetStore;

@route("/feed")
op feed(food: Food): void;

model Food {
  name: string;
  quantity: int32;
}
```

```typespec title="client.tsp"
import "./main.tsp";
import "@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core";

namespace Customization;

@@clientNamespace(PetStore.Food, "PetStore.Models");
```

```python
# TODO
```

```csharp
// TODO
```

```typescript
// TODO
```

```java
// TODO
```

</ClientTabs>

## License

The license info is auto-generated in the client code header as well as in the `LICENSE` file depending on the language's emitter.

## Azure license

For Azure scenarios, client code will always use the MIT license and include the license info in the header of the generated code or in a separate file depending on the language.

For example, this is the license comment in the generated code of a Java client:

```java
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
// Licensed under the MIT License.
```

This is the `LICENSE` file of a Python client library:

```text
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation

of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights

LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN
THE SOFTWARE.
```

## Unbranded license

For unbranded scenarios, client code will have no license info if there is no `license` configuration in `tspconfig.yaml`.
Spec authors can set the license info with the `license` configuration in the `tspconfig.yaml`, the configuration is as follows:

```yaml
license:
  name: <License name. This is required. We have built-in "MIT License", "Apache License 2.0", "BSD 3-Clause License", "MPL 2.0", "GPL-3.0", and "LGPL-3.0". If you use build-in license, you only need to set the name and company. For other licenses, you need to set the name, company, link, header, and description manually.>
  company: <Company name. Optional. For build-in license, it will affect the copyright sentence.>
  link: <License link. Optional. If you want a customized license, you need to set the link manually.>
  header: <License header in the generated code. Optional. If you want a customized license, you need to set the header manually.>
  description: <License description in the separate license file. Optional. If you want a customized license, you need to set the description manually.>
```

For example, if you configure the license using a built-in license:

```yaml
emit:
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-python"
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-java"
options:
  "@azure-tools/typespec-python":
    license:
      name: "Apache License 2.0"
      company: "Microsoft Corporation"
  "@azure-tools/typespec-java":
    license:
      name: "Apache License 2.0"
      company: "Microsoft Corporation"
```

This is the license comment in the generated code of a Java client:

```java
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
// Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
```

This is the `LICENSE` file of a Python client library:

```text

If you configure the license using a customized license:

```yaml
emit:
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-python"
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-java"
options:
  "@azure-tools/typespec-python":
    license:

  "@azure-tools/typespec-java":
    license:
      name: "Mozilla Public License 2.0"
      link: "https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/"
      header: "This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/."

```

```yaml
emit:
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-python"
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-java"
options:
  "@azure-tools/typespec-python":
    license:

  "@azure-tools/typespec-java":
    license:

      company: "Microsoft Corporation"
```
