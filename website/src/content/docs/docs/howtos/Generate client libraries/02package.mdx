title: Common Behavior for Client Packages
---

import { ClientTabs, ClientTabItem } from "@components/client-tabs";

This page documents the common behavior for a client package, including the service, namespace, license, and more.

## Service

The service acts as the entry point for a client library. Currently, only one service per package is supported. The service is defined using the `@service` decorator. If multiple services are defined, the first one will be used as the entry point.

## Namespace

Clients, models, enums, and unions in TypeSpec include namespace information. Code generators for different languages use this information to organize the generated code.

### Basic Example

<ClientTabs>

```typespec title="main.tsp"
@service(#{ title: "Pet Store" })
namespace PetStore;

@route("/feed")
op feed(food: Food): void;

model Food {
  name: string;
  quantity: int32;
}
```

```python
# TODO
```

```csharp
// TODO
```

```typescript
import { PetStoreClient,Food } from "@azure/package-name";

const client = new PetStoreClient();
const food:Food = {
    name: "food";
    quantity: 3;
}
client.feed(food);
```

```java
// Client builder class
package petstore;

@ServiceClientBuilder(serviceClients = { PetStoreClient.class, PetStoreAsyncClient.class })
public final class PetStoreClientBuilder implements HttpTrait<PetStoreClientBuilder>,
    ConfigurationTrait<PetStoreClientBuilder>, EndpointTrait<PetStoreClientBuilder> {

    public PetStoreClientBuilder();

    public PetStoreClient buildClient();
}

// Client class
@ServiceClient(builder = PetStoreClientBuilder.class)
public final class PetStoreClient {
    public void feed(Food food);
}

// Model class
package petstore.models;

@Immutable
public final class Food implements JsonSerializable<Food> {
    public Food(String name, int quantity);

    public String getName();
    public int getQuantity();
}
```

</ClientTabs>

### Customization

You can use the `@clientNamespace` decorator to customize the namespace for specific clients, enums, models, or unions.

<ClientTabs>

```typespec title="main.tsp"
@service(#{ title: "Pet Store" })
namespace PetStore;

@route("/feed")
op feed(food: Food): void;

model Food {
  name: string;
  quantity: int32;
}
```

```typespec title="client.tsp"
import "./main.tsp";
import "@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core";

namespace Customization;

@@clientNamespace(PetStore.Food, "PetStore.Models");
```

```python
# TODO
```

```csharp
// TODO
```

```typescript
// TODO
```

```java
// Client builder class
package petstore;

@ServiceClientBuilder(serviceClients = { PetStoreClient.class, PetStoreAsyncClient.class })
public final class PetStoreClientBuilder implements HttpTrait<PetStoreClientBuilder>,
    ConfigurationTrait<PetStoreClientBuilder>, EndpointTrait<PetStoreClientBuilder> {

    public PetStoreClientBuilder();

    public PetStoreClient buildClient();
}

// Client class
@ServiceClient(builder = PetStoreClientBuilder.class)
public final class PetStoreClient {
    public void feed(Food food);
}

// Model class
package petstore.models;

@Immutable
public final class Food implements JsonSerializable<Food> {
    public Food(String name, int quantity);

    public String getName();
    public int getQuantity();
}
```

</ClientTabs>

## License

License information is automatically generated in the client code header and the `LICENSE` file, depending on the language's emitter.

### Azure License

For Azure scenarios, client code always uses the MIT license. The license information is included in the header of the generated code or in a separate file, depending on the language.

For example, here is the license comment in the generated code of a Java client:

```java
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
// Licensed under the MIT License.
```

And here is the `LICENSE` file for a Python client library:

```text
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights

LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,

THE SOFTWARE.
```

### Unbranded License

For unbranded scenarios, client code will not include license information unless it is configured in `tspconfig.yaml`. Spec authors can define license information using the `license` configuration in `tspconfig.yaml` as shown below:

```yaml
license:
  name: <License name. This is required. We support built-in licenses such as "MIT License", "Apache License 2.0", "BSD 3-Clause License", "MPL 2.0", "GPL-3.0", and "LGPL-3.0". For custom licenses, you must provide the name, company, link, header, and description manually.>
  company: <Company name. Optional. For built-in licenses, this affects the copyright statement.>
  link: <License link. Optional. Required for custom licenses.>
  header: <License header in the generated code. Optional. Required for custom licenses.>
  description: <License description in the separate license file. Optional. Required for custom licenses.>
```

#### Example: Built-in License

```yaml
emit:
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-python"
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-java"
options:
  "@azure-tools/typespec-python":
    license:
      name: "Apache License 2.0"
      company: "Microsoft Corporation"
  "@azure-tools/typespec-java":
    license:
      name: "Apache License 2.0"
      company: "Microsoft Corporation"
```
