import { ClientTabs, ClientTabItem } from "@components/client-tabs";

This page explains how the license info is generated in the client code.

## Azure license

For Azure scenarios, client code will always use the MIT license and include the license info in the header of the generated code or in a separate file depending on the language.

For example, this is the license comment in the generated code of a Java client:

```java
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
// Licensed under the MIT License.
```

This is the `LICENSE` file of a Python client library:

```text

LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,

THE SOFTWARE.
```

## Unbranded license

For unbranded scenarios, client code will have no license info if there is no `license` configuration in `tspconfig.yaml`.
Spec authors can set the license info with the `license` configuration in the `tspconfig.yaml`, the configuration is as follows:

```yaml
license:
  name: <License name. This is required. We have built-in "MIT License", "Apache License 2.0", "BSD 3-Clause License", "MPL 2.0", "GPL-3.0", and "LGPL-3.0". If you use build-in license, you only need to set the name and company. For other licenses, you need to set the name, company, link, header, and description manually.>
  company: <Company name. Optional. For build-in license, it will affect the copyright sentence.>
  link: <License link. Optional. If you want a customized license, you need to set the link manually.>
  header: <License header in the generated code. Optional. If you want a customized license, you need to set the header manually.>
  description: <License description in the separate license file. Optional. If you want a customized license, you need to set the description manually.>
```

For example, if you configure the license using a built-in license:

```yaml
emit:
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-python"
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-java"
options:
  "@azure-tools/typespec-python":
    license:
      name: "Apache License 2.0"
      company: "Microsoft Corporation"
  "@azure-tools/typespec-java":
    license:
      name: "Apache License 2.0"
      company: "Microsoft Corporation"
```

This is the license comment in the generated code of a Java client:

```java
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
// Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
```

If you configure the license using a customized license:

```yaml
emit:
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-python"
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-java"
options:
  "@azure-tools/typespec-python":
