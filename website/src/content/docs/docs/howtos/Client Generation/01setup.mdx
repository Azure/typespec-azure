This page explains how to setup customization of a generator if necessary.

Your `package.json` needs to contains a link to the customization library, `typespec-client-generator-core`:

```json
{
  "name": "clients",
  "dependencies": {
    "@typespec/compiler": "latest",
    "@typespec/http": "latest",
    "@typespec/rest": "latest",
    "@azure-tools/typespec-azure-core": "latest",
    "@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core": "latest"
  },
  "private": true
}
```

Customization should always be done in a file called `client.tsp` along with the `main.tsp`.

```typespec
// client.tsp
import "./main.tsp";
import "@azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-core";

using Azure.ClientGenerator.Core;

// Your customizations here
```

Once you have a customization file, you should compile with your client.tsp to get output that includes the customizations:

```shell
tsp compile client.tsp
```
