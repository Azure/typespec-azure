title: "Generating experiences in Azure Portal with TypeSpec"

Go to the [TypeSpec guide](https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-portal-framework-ibizafx/declarative/typespec) to learn how to customize your Azure Portal experience, generated by default for your ARM resource type. Azure Resource Providers can apply TypeSpec decorators to generate and brand Azure Portal experiences.

## About Default Experiences

Azure Portal generates end-to-end experiences automatically, providing Resource Providers with immediate UX in Azure Portal for their resource types. This pipeline runs offline and generates views and an asset for your resource type. These generated experiences done by Azure Portal based on resource type metadata are called "Default Experiences". Leveraging TypeSpec affords Resource Providers with an easy, declarative way of branding and promoting these experiences, as the generated default experience is hidden by default.
