title: How to suppress warnings
---

This article helps you to suppress warning messages generated by TypeSpec and libraries.

## Symptoms

TypeSpec core and libraries could generate and output warning messages based on linting rules.

## Cause

These linting rules are introduced to ensure high-quality specs being generated. Sometimes they are used to call out areas needs developer attention to meet library or organization guidelines.

## Workaround

Some of the rules after review can be suppressed to get clean compile outputs using `#suppress ErrCode ReasonMsg` statement. The error code is the string reported in compiler output.

For example:

```tsp
#suppress "@azure-tools/typespec-providerhub/no-identifier-property-in-array-item" "Error items have no unique identifier."
@doc("An array of details about specific errors that led to this reported error.")
details: Error[];
```
