```

ARM resources must declare the complete set of required lifecycle and list
operations defined by the [ARM RPC contract][rpc] (sections 2.2 and 2.3).

The required set depends on the resource kind:

| Resource kind                             | Required operations                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tracked                                   | `read`, `createOrUpdate`, `delete`, `list-by-resource-group`, `list-by-subscription` |
| Proxy / Extension (top-level)             | `read`, `createOrUpdate`, `delete`                                                   |
| Proxy / Extension (nested under a parent) | `read`, `createOrUpdate`, `delete`, `list-by-parent`                                 |
| Singleton (any kind)                      | `read`, `createOrUpdate` only — no `delete`, no `list`                               |

When more than one operation is missing, a single diagnostic is emitted that
lists every missing operation. When only one is missing, a more specific
message ID is used so editors and tooling can present a clearer hint.

This rule is singleton-aware and supersedes
[`no-resource-delete-operation`](./no-resource-delete-operation.md). Both rules
are currently registered for backwards compatibility.

#### ❌ Incorrect — tracked resource missing the delete and list operations

```tsp
@armResourceOperations
interface EmployeeOperations {
  read is ArmResourceRead<Employee>;
  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<Employee>;
}
```

#### ✅ Correct — complete operation set for a tracked resource

```tsp
@armResourceOperations
interface EmployeeOperations {
  read is ArmResourceRead<Employee>;
  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<Employee>;
  delete is ArmResourceDeleteWithoutOkAsync<Employee>;
  listByResourceGroup is ArmResourceListByParent<Employee>;
  listBySubscription is ArmListBySubscription<Employee>;
}
```

#### ✅ Correct — singleton resource (no delete or list required)

```tsp
@singleton
model Settings is ProxyResource<SettingsProperties> {
  @key
  @path
  @segment("settings")
  name: string;
}

@armResourceOperations
interface SettingsOperations {
  read is ArmResourceRead<Settings>;
  createOrUpdate is ArmResourceCreateOrReplaceAsync<Settings>;
}
```
