```

ARM operation responses with status code 202 or 204 should not contain a response body. Operation responses with other success (2xx) status codes should contain a response body.

### For 202 and 204 status codes (response body should be empty)

#### ❌ Incorrect

```tsp
op walk(): ArmNoContentResponse & {
  @body body: string;
};
```

```json
{
  "responses": {
    "204": {
      "description": "There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful. ",
      "schema": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### ✅ Correct

```tsp
op walk(): ArmAcceptedResponse;
```

```json
{
  "responses": {
    "202": {
      "description": "The request has been accepted for processing, but processing has not yet completed."
    }
  }
}
```

### For other success (2xx) response status codes (response body should not be empty)

#### ❌ Incorrect

```tsp
op walk(): CreatedResponse;
```

```json
{
  "responses": {
    "201": {
      "description": "The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result."
    }
  }
}
```

#### ✅ Correct

```tsp
op walk(): ArmCreatedResponse<{
  name: string;
}>;
```

```json
{
  "responses": {
    "201": {
      "description": "Azure create operation completed successfully.",
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "name": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        "required": ["name"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
