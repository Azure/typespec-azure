# Getting started with TypeSpec migration

We have created a swagger to TypeSpec conversion tool to help take on the bulk of the manual conversion labor. It can handle both data-plane and management-plane swaggers. The produced TypeSpec relies on the Azure.Core and Azure.Resource.Manager libraries.

**_Important!_** Because TypeSpec is more expressive than Swagger and with the help of evolving Azure libraries, this tool should only be used as an aid in the conversion/migration process, not as the sole tool to produce final version of TypeSpec specs without human inspection, correction and optimization.

## Steps of migration and comparison

### Prerequisite

- Clone [azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs).
- Install dependencies:
  ```shell
  npm install # Run at root
  ```

### Generate TypeSpec with converter

- Go to your `specification/{service-name}` folder in `azure-rest-api-specs`.
- Create a directory holding TypeSpec files. See details [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/documentation/typespec-structure-guidelines.md).
- Run the tool from the directory.

  - Convert a **data-plane** specification:

    ```shell
    tsp-client convert --swagger-readme [path to readme.md]
    ```

  - Convert a **control-plane** specification:

    ```shell
    tsp-client convert --swagger-readme [path to readme.md] --arm
    ```

  - Convert a **control-plane** specification to fully compatible output:

    By default, the converted TypeSpec project will leverage TypeSpec built-in libraries with standard patterns and templates (highly recommended), which will cause discrepancies between the generated TypeSpec and original swagger. If you really don't want this intended discrepancy, add `--fully-compatible` flag to generate a TypeSpec project that is fully compatible with the swagger.

    ```shell
    tsp-client convert --swagger-readme [path to readme.md] --arm --fully-compatible
    ```

### Review and adjust the TypeSpec

You will need to compare the Swagger generated from TypeSpec with your original Swagger specification(s) to ensure functional equivalence.

- In your TypeSpec folder, compile your TypeSpec files to emit an auto-generated Swagger:

  ```shell
  tsp compile .
  ```

- From the root folder, download the latest specification as baseline. Your original specification will be located at `.\sparse-spec\specification\{service-name}`:

  ```shell
  .\eng\tools\typespec-migration-validation\scripts\download-main.ps1 {path\to\your\generated\swagger}
  ```

- At the end of the console output, you'll see the next command to sort, merge, and normalize your original Swagger(s) and generated Swagger, making it easier to review changes. Provide an `outputFolder` to store the analysis results:

  ```shell
  npx tsmv {your\original\swagger\folder} {your\generated\swagger\file} {outputFolder}
  ```

- In the `{outputFolder}`:

  - `newNormalizedSwagger.json` is the processed version of your generated Swagger
  - `oldNormalizedSwagger.json` is the processed version of your original Swagger(s)

  In VS Code, select both files (select `oldNormalizedSwagger.json` first, then `newNormalizedSwagger.json`), right-click and choose "Compare Selected". Review these differences to understand their patterns.

- Check out the output from `npx tsmv` execution. It prints suggested fixes and prompts if any. Please review them before any run.

  **Suggested fixes:** These provide exact TypeSpec code that you can apply directly by following the instructions.

  **Suggested prompts:** To use these, drag all your TypeSpec files into GitHub Copilot context. Select "Agent" or "Edit" mode with the "Claude" model. Use the provided prompt to ask GitHub Copilot to generate fixes. Carefully review all changes before accepting or undoing them.

- For remaining differences, follow this iterative process:
  1. Recompile your TypeSpec files with `tsp compile .` in your TypeSpec folder.
  2. Run the `npx tsmv` command again with the same parameters.
  3. Review the updated differences in VS Code.
  4. Make further adjustments as needed. For more effective visualization, fix differences in this recommended order:
     - Path (route) differences first
     - Definition (model) name differences next
     - Detail differences within paths and definitions last

### Create Spec PR with new TypeSpec project

- Review CI checks such as breaking changes and other failures.
